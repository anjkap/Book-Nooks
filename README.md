# Book-Nooks
Book Nooks is an app I created for the Congressional App Challenge 2023. It is an app that allows users to exchange and borrw books, creating initiative in the community to share their books and interact with others.
## Features
The app takes advantage of Django's built-in user authentication system, which allows each user to have a personalized experience within the app. When users create an account, they may select their preferred genres and age range, and their recommendations will be matched accordingly. 

Books have several attributes, including their genre, author, and minimum age. This makes it easy for users to search for books of a general type. They also each have a unique information page which users view before checking out the book. Users also have the ability to rate books.

Users can add books to their profile, and this makes the book available to others to check out if they choose. 
## Possible Updates
The app could use a better navigation system, allowing users to find the books closest to them. This would also be useful to designate real-life "Nooks" for people to borrow and donate books.

Creating a chat feature would also be good to help users communicate about their books and if they want to do something like permanantly exchange books or meet up, increasing the sense of community this app creates. Implementing this would also come with implementing many safety features to protect underage users.
